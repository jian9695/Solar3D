osgEarth Sample - Multiple files in GDAL driver

This example displays how to use the GDAL driver to load files in a directory as a single, logical layer.

Note:  There are tons of NoData areas in the sample terrain files, so expect see some holes :)

<map type="geocentric" version="2">
    
    <options>
        <terrain vertical_scale="3"/>
    </options>

    <!--Load a simple base image of the world-->
    <image name="world" driver="gdal">
        <url>..\data\world.tif</url>
    </image>

    <!--Load a folder full of terrain data as an elevation source-->
    <elevation name="terrain" driver="gdal">

        <!--To load the files in a directory, just point the URL to a directory instead of a file-->
        <url>..\data\terrain</url>

        <!--
          You can filter out what files you want to load by providing a semi-colon delimited list of files.
          Uncomment the following, for instance, to load only DTED levels 0, 1 or 2.  If you don't provide
          an extensions list, the GDAL driver will try every file in the directory.
        -->
        <!--<extensions>dt0;dt1;dt2</extensions>-->	  
	  
	    <!--Tell the GDAL driver to just look for tifs-->
	    <extensions>tif</extensions>  

    </elevation>
